Just a stimulation problem. but we need to remember the position as well so we add the position to the queue and icremented
the time and only add when its greater than 0. our ticket person is with position k and tickets 0. then we break.



class Solution:
    def timeRequiredToBuy(self, tickets: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        time=0
        q=deque()
        n=len(tickets)
        for i in range(n):
            q.append((tickets[i],i))
        while q:
            x,y=q.popleft()
            time+=1
            if (x-1)!=0:
                q.append((x-1,y))
            if x-1 ==0 and y==k:
                break
        return time
