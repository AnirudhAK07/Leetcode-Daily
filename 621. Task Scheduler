Observation:

1. We need to try to complete the most frequent characters. So we are being greedy here so we use greedy approach.

class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        charfreq=[0]*26 # for counting the no.of characters
        for task in tasks:
            charfreq[ord(task)-ord('A')]+=1
        charfreq.sort()
        maxidle=charfreq[-1]-1#we do need at the end
        idle=maxidle*n #max no.of idle spaces

        for i in range(24,-1,-1):
            idle-=min(maxidle,charfreq[i])# filling with task to minimize idle spaces
        return len(tasks)+idle if idle>=0 else len(tasks)
