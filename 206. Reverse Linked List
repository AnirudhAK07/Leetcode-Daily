Bit tricky . Be cautious while interchanging the links.
Mistakes : making the currents.next to previous and going cur to current.next so to the previous node. Lost some time.

Be Cautious working with linked list like a surgeon.Cuting nerves and joining them. if Something gone wrong.Case closed


Solution:


class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev=None
        cur=head
        while(cur):
            temp=cur.next
            cur.next=prev
            prev=cur
            cur=temp   #cur.next was stored in the temp for future because we are changing   
        return prev   #cur.next link
